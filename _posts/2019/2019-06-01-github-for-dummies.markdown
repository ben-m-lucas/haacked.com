A while back, Zach Holman gave a great talk about [How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub](https://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/). The talk focused a lot on GitHub's approach to coordinating work on [github.com](https://github.com/). But the way GitHub uses GitHub goes beyond code. It's not just github.com, but GitHub the company. For example, the employee handbook is in a GitHub repository. This makes it easy to suggest corrections and changes and see a history of its changes.

During my nearly seven year stint at GitHub, I was deeply emeshed in this way of working. It's especially powerful for coordinating the activities of distributed teams. So I think I can be forgiven for assuming everyone who uses GitHub works in this way.

It's not that I expected that everyone worked the same way. It's that I assumed everyone understood the set of features available to them. As I get involved with some distributed teams, I'm learning that people are not aware of features that would save them a lot of time and headache.

And it's understandable, GitHub picked up its pace with shipping features. But some of the features I'm thinking about have been around a long time. For example, the ability to [suggest a change to a pull request](https://github.blog/2018-11-01-suggested-changes-update/) without having to create a fork and submit another pull request is extremely useful.

If long-time GitHub users are not aware of these features, what about people new to GitHub? Using GitHub as a new developer, or as an experienced developer new to GitHub, can be daunting. If you're in this situation, or know someone who is, I have just the book for you.

My former colleague and friend, Sarah Guthals and I wrote a book about GitHub as part of the popular For Dummies series. The title, as you might guess, is GitHub for Dummies. It's [available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Qr31t1).

The book covers a lot of interesting topics. Some of my favorites are the chapters that cover both sides of working on an open source repository. It contains great tips on how to be a good contributor (pro tip: put away that sense of entitlement) and how to be a good maintainer (pro tip: be kind and take care of your own health first). The book covers a lot of features you might not be aware of and shows them in the context of a typical developer workflow.
